## 1.1.2

- A cut at or below -50 LUFS counts as silent, the sound layer's line: a speech-free style with no music is not failed for sound.
- A still scene may hold for as long as it lasts: a held picture over 4 s fails only when it runs on past a scene start, or when the style asks for footage_moves or the timeline names no scenes.

## 1.1.1

- logo_visible is checked across the whole video (the end card included), apart from the end-card logo check.

## 1.1.0

- Free: on-camera speech is checked from the transcript a transcribe step puts in the timeline; an unmarked end card the style needs fails; logo_visible is checked on its own; a declared logo zone bounds the match.

## 1.0.0

- First version: the server's five checks plus black and frozen frames, end card and speech against the script.
